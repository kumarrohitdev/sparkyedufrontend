      <h2>Returns</h2>
      <p>
        You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received
        it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the
        same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original
        packaging. Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of purchase.
      </p>
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we
        have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the
        status of your refund after inspecting the item. If your return is
        approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original
        method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount
        of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
      </p>
      <h2>Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for
        returning your item. Shipping costs are nonÂ­refundable. If you receive a
        refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.
